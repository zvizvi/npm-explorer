#### [This is a fork of `nikitaeverywhere/npm-explorer` repository, formerly hosted on `npm-explorer.tk`]

The main purpose of this service is to improve quality of NPM packages, primarily because many people
publish a lot of unnecessary files to NPM (like CI configs, tests, build tools or even whole repositories).
This service helps to see what files does NPM package include along with some other metrics regarding
to the package quality.

You can easily hotlink packages, individual files and even selected line numbers, for example:

```txt
https://npm-explorer.vercel.app/?p=lodash/LICENSE
```
